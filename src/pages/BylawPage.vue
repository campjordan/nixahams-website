            The matter was to have been presented to the Members at a regular or special meeting, and that meeting failed due to the lack of a quorum.

            Then the Executive Committee may take any action with respect to such matter as the Members could have taken if it had been presented to them, subject to the following limitations:
            No Full Member, Associate Member, or Family Membership may be expelled;

            No elections may be held;
